<h1> FullStack Project :) </h1>

Creating a full-stack development project using Angular, Spring Boot, REST API, and MySQL is a great way to build a modern web application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

<h1> 1. Set Up Your Development Environment: </h1>

Before you start coding, make sure you have the necessary tools and software installed:

- Install Node.js and Angular CLI for front-end development.
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Spring Boot for the back-end.
- Install MySQL or use a cloud-based MySQL service.

<h1> 2. Plan Your Project: </h1>

Define the purpose and requirements of your application. What will it do? What features do you need? Create a project plan and a database schema design. Decide on the user interface and user experience.

<h1> 3. Create the Backend with Spring Boot: </h1>

1. Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer or your IDE.
2. Define your entity classes, which represent your database tables.
3. Set up JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interaction.
4. Create RESTful APIs using Spring MVC to expose endpoints for CRUD operations.
5. Implement security features if needed (e.g., Spring Security).
6. Set up your application properties to configure the database connection.

<h1>  4. Create the Frontend with Angular: </h1>

1. Generate a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
2. Design your user interface using Angular components, templates, and styles.
3. Use Angular services to communicate with your RESTful APIs.
4. Implement routing to navigate between different parts of your application.
5. Handle user authentication and authorization if required.

<h1> 5. Connect Angular to the Spring Boot Backend: </h1>

Use Angular's HTTP client to make requests to your Spring Boot API endpoints. Ensure that you handle data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion correctly.

<h1> 6. Set Up MySQL Database: </h1>

1. Create the MySQL database and tables based on your database schema design.
2. Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to the MySQL database using the appropriate JDBC settings.


Build the core functionality of your application. This can include user registration, login, data management, and any other features you planned in the project requirements.

**8. Testing:**

Write unit tests for both the frontend (Angular) and backend (Spring Boot) to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code.
